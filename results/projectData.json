        "project_information": "\nOYO defies simple classification; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a hospitality-technology powerhouse transforming the travel experience on a global scale.\nRitesh Agarwal started the company in 2013 to address a neglected corner of the Indian hospitality landscape: the economy hotel room. Before OYO, travelers on a budget had few reliable options and were forced to take a leap of faith to stay at completely unfamiliar, locally-owned hotels or stay with family. Discovering and booking these properties was also a challenge \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the in-person experience was too often a let-down.\nOYO was founded with the belief that everyone deserves access to quality travel experiences, regardless of their budget. In bringing this vision to life, OYO transformed the industry, partnering with local hotels to ensure they meet a set of core customer experience promises. OYO has also developed their own proprietary software to streamline operations for property owners and elevate the experience of every OYO stay.\nOur partnership with OYO began with a two-week, cross-country immersion across India. The COLLINS team engaged the OYO experience firsthand, staying at properties from Mumbai to Shirdi to Goa to Delhi. In-person ethnographies allowed us a more intimate understanding of Indian culture; our strategy workshop with OYO leadership helped us identify the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s values and goals.\nTogether, we realized that OYO enables movement in the geographic sense \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but also that travel, new experiences and new spaces move us as people, too. Expanding horizons. And evolving lives for the better.\nIn developing a new brand and creative system with OYO, our goal was to grow a new emblem for everyone with a desire to go, to explore. The new working identity program was a manifestation of this notion; always on the move, adapting to different contexts, seeking new expressions. Always anticipating and accommodating. A new identity that  remains familiar for those who already love it and inviting for those who want to know more.\nThe supporting design system works to be friendly and vivid, like OYO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthplace, but restrained in its expression. A modular system designed to be flexible and highly functional \u00e2\u0080\u0093 supported by new photography, illustration, and expressive patterns. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a working, coherent toolkit that focuses their internal creative teams, while also encouraging the use of their own artistry and exuberance across the expanding range of OYO properties and locations.\nA simple idea with a kaleidoscope of expressions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like OYO itself.\n",

With many new channels and players flooding the fast fashion market, being affordable and on-trend was no longer a meaningful point of brand differentiation for Aldo.\nSolution\nOur goal was to push Aldo away from discount retail and into a more premium position and expression. Every aspect of the experience now works to build the trust and enthusiasm consumers have for Aldo products. By introducing a new design system and fine-tuning key elements (like carefully re-crafting their famous logotype) we established a strong foundation that guided us through the development of every part of the brand experience \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from packaging, in-store signage and digital displays to their digital advertising, web and mobile expressions.\nWe also created a new communication program for Aldo based on layered, collage-based art direction and photography.

They emulate his tactics as they dream of becoming competitive gamers.\nGaming has become a radically different world in under a decade. Streaming gameplay pulls more viewers than all the major sports leagues. Esports alone draws a bigger audience than MLB, the NBA and the NHL. Only the NFL eclipses it. Additionally, the industry has recently undergone a major shift in its business model: from one-time, single-game purchases towards \u00e2\u0080\u009cgaming as a service\u00e2\u0080\u009d via subscriptions to game libraries. This lowered the cost barrier to play, increasing the number of players, and fueling streaming viewership.\nWatching from the sidelines was Facebook.\nWith its 700-million-person gaming community, Facebook needed a share of this market. It was one of the few markets big enough to grow the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advertising revenue.\nFacebook Gaming, offering both games-as-a-service and streaming, staked a unique positioning. While Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, aimed their cloud gaming strategies at big-budget \u00e2\u0080\u009cAAA\u00e2\u0080\u009d titles, Facebook focused on the world of casual free-to-play games.\nBut, a major obstacle blocked this expansion strategy: Facebook wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t credible in gaming, let alone known for it. The last time it had tried to be a major mass-market gaming platform was the FarmVille era a decade ago. Yes, they had a differentiated product. But, unless Facebook could diversify its perception, no one would notice.\nSOLUTION\nWorking closely with the Gaming team, we created a unique identity for the product. It blended Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core brand equities with gaming\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visual codes and cues. In the creative process, an unlikely hero emerged: the glyph. A simple, modular symbol, the glyph anchors the brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expressive system, bridging the world of Facebook and gaming to signal that the social media company could also be a legit gaming company.\n",

The dedication to each student as an individual became the inspiration behind our design approach.\nThe identity for Summit was then crafted by COLLINS, as well as the Summit students and teachers. Using scissors and cut paper, the teams created letterforms and characters that introduced students to design and typography. The result is a custom Summit typeface developed in collaboration with Oh No Foundry in San Francisco.\nOur cut paper explorations also resulted in a series of characters that can be used to represent the students and teachers themselves. The Personalized Learning Platform now uses a custom tool that allows everyone to create their own unique avatar.\nResult\nThe result is a flexible and highly personalized design system that captures the energy of the students, and Summit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dedication to finding the best, most focused solution for every child.\nThe system is currently being implemented across the Summit digital platforms, as well as at each of its 11 schools along the west coast.\n",

They are mirrors that reflect who we are \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the best and not-so-best parts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and grow us into new ways of living. They are bridges to becoming better.\nFinding love used to be a predictable process resting on ancient tectonic plates of behavior, until 1995, when a rush of new energy moved those plates, permanently shifting the landscape.\nChallenge\nSince its founding, Match has pioneered a land of online dating. Their vision was a seed planted in the vast new expanse of the internet, germinating an entirely new category, opening up a world that ushered in an assortment of platforms and, in turn, cultures.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no wonder that dating has become a panic-induced, anxiety-ridden journey. We now act as if the last train is leaving the station. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re either too cynical to get on or we take the wrong one and never get off.\nThe challenge for leaders is to show what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible while also learning from history. Every now and then, a brand has to empty out its bag and reorder it for their next adventure. Match was sitting on a treasure trove of experience and knowledge gained over 25 years, ready to be reassembled and reorganized for a new future.\nEvolving Match has been about taking the most powerful, meaningful qualities of their brand and delivering them in a new way; to expand the story, the language and the capabilities to be of better service to people who are confident and eager to live in more intentional ways.\nSolution\nLeveraging their long track record of success and industry mastery, we zoomed in on where Match is unmatched.\nIf apps today are a means to an end for dating, what is the opposite edge of this? How can a product feel more like a beloved service rather than a convenient game?\nEnter: hospitality and concierge. Where other apps forcibly push you to \u00e2\u0080\u009cengage\u00e2\u0080\u009d and maximize your limits \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to then pay for more maximum engagement \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Match strives for the effortlessness of a concierge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wave, showing you to your table; almost invisible but deeply appreciated.\nA logo implies something more than its obvious meaning. The heart moved from the top to the bottom\u00e2\u0080\u0094full stop\u00e2\u0080\u0094 indicates the confidence in service that Match represents. Match becomes a simple statement and a clear ambition. The original helped Match light the way; this new logo shows they have arrived.\nThe color palette has evolved to fit the context in which Match is readily used. No glaring, bright colors, but tonal and inviting.\nFor decades, people have looked to Match with high expectations: They knew what they were looking for, and they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t settle for less. At every touchpoint, from creating a profile to being onboarded into their world, people knew that if you were on Match, you were ready to connect. We brought that trust and experience back to the forefront.\nIt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take minutes to create a profile; it takes time and intention. Dating, then, is not an end. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the means.\nBy working cross-functionally with Match\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive, product, design, and marketing teams, the new brand strategy enabled us to amplify the experience of Match while also paving new roads for a more inclusive, ever-changing environment of dating. To feel elegant, playful, intimate, and inviting. The technology works so the conversation can flow effortlessly forward.\nMatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new features, finely honed expertise built over time, and standard of service, allows them to re-emerge in the universe that they created. From hiring dating experts to new iconography and language that encourages you to be more open to the myriad of possibilities, Match supports you to focus on the good stuff: getting to know someone. They craft anticipation into the experience. Now, smiling down at your phone will be the work of design.\nThis is not about pressing buttons or acing an algorithm. This is about the long-haul. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the bedrock of conversations that sprout serendipity and connection. Rather than a slip into cynicism, you might fall hard for the right person.\nA few months before the official launch, Match tested the new identity to see how it resonated with their customers. A 13% increase across all key metrics on Match\u00e2\u0080\u0099s platform revealed that the new identity and language was, well \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 loved.\nEvolution is not about discarding the old you. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about reamplifying the traits that are most unique to you. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about using design to craft symbols, stories, and opportunities that shape hearts and minds for a new future.\n",

CNET\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experts save us from TMI by focusing on the latest info that helps us.\nSecond, most of the news that people think is worth their time, actually isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Even the most trustworthy outlets often fail to tell us how to use their reporting to improve our day-to-day life. But CNET provides coverage that connects those dots, from general awareness to taking action.\nCNET realized their type of service journalism\u00e2\u0080\u0094elevating what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important and making it applicable\u00e2\u0080\u0094extends beyond tech. Which is why they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now expanding their coverage and advice to what matters most in modern life, including money, home, wellness, culture, cars and climate.\nTo help the world notice, they invited COLLINS to craft a new brand strategy, story and identity that transforms CNET from a tech-review site into an editorial-first brand people trust for its shockingly useful information as much as its expertise.\nSOLUTION\nAfter meeting with their editors and publishers to discuss their renewed vision for CNET, we saw how their combination of expert reporters and multiple channels could turn a constantly changing world into practical opportunities for people.\nMore than just looking like a different type of news source, we worked with CNET to better express their unique form of service journalism. They are now able to articulate what they want people to do with CNET\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reporting\u00e2\u0080\u0094and set the bar for what the rest of the industry should provide. To signal this transformation, we had to plant CNET\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flag alongside other trustworthy, timely and leading news organizations.\nFaced with today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partisan publications on one end and clickbait factories on the other, we looked to broadcast journalism giants from the 1950s through 1970s\u00e2\u0080\u0094the decades before the FCC abolished the fairness doctrine requiring outlets to represent differing viewpoints. A time when the news was deeply respected and viewed as a public good.\nThis led us to create a new wordmark that aims to be trustworthy while also pointing to a fresh way forward. It heralds a new and open editorial experience that allows their stories and advice to have a sense of importance\u00e2\u0080\u0094in any media channel\u00e2\u0080\u0094without crowding each other out.\nIn marketing their new approach, we also leaned into bold surrealism for its ability to spark people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imaginations about what they could expect to achieve with CNET\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coverage. It encompasses a new brand voice that seeks to make talking about the news enjoyable\u00e2\u0080\u0094while remaining distinct from their helpful editorial style.\nWith a refocused story and new identity, CNET is poised to make people notice that the news can be something more than fleeting ideological talking points or mindless clickbait\u00e2\u0080\u0094it can turn the daily firehose of information into a useful tool that improves their lives every day.\n",

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the meeting of minds, the occasional 5 AM class (hi, Hank Richardson), and the 100 or so sketches you do to discover the threshold where your best work arrives.\nWith programs in Art Direction, Copywriting, Creative Technology, Design, Photo & Video, Social Strategy, Strategic Planning, and UX Design\u00e2\u0080\u0094M.AD is home to passionate misfits, rookie visionaries, and some of the most awarded alumni on the planet. A global network with 15 schools around the world from Berlin to Buenos Aires.\nM.AD, now over 25 years old, was ready to evolve. They invited us to define their brand strategy, and reimagine their mission, their brand, and its expression. Together we sought to embrace their legacy whilst acknowledging education is never static. It must change to respect and anticipate the future. So the talent of tomorrow can find their voices and thrive in the face of fear. Overcoming every daunting blank page to arrive at the ideas that move our world.\nSolution\nCreativity belongs to all of us.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wired innately into the functioning of every human brain. But to wield and master it is a process that can only be honed over time with persistence. The best people to learn from, when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re tapping into your innate creative force, are those who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve discovered how to command theirs. The teachers who send the elevator back down, challenge your spirit, and spur you on to follow your path.\nIn developing our strategy, we recognized M.AD School of Ideas as a place where this resilience of imagination flourishes. Where the lifelong, never-settling journey of finding and expressing your voice is set in motion.\nM.AD cultivates unconventional minds.\nTo bring this idea to life, we created the M.AD / M-dot mark. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cM\u00e2\u0080\u009d: a fluid form constantly changing and recreating itself. And the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdot\u00e2\u0080\u009d: an always present, steadfast counterpoint. Never without each other\u00e2\u0080\u0094they reflect the dance of the process. The tensions in constant dialogue with each other. Be it the interplay between passion and discipline. Wild optimism and unwavering rigor. The audacious thinking that transcends limits and the remarkable craft you need to make it real.\nTo support the new mark, we developed a color strategy that builds upon the vibrant pink M.AD is recognized for. Like plastic flamingos or a beachside sunset, our primary pink is true to their Miami roots.\n",

        "project_information": "\nOPPORTUNITY\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start at the top: 1912. Savannah, Georgia.\nJuliette Gordon Low has an idea: prepare girls to meet the world with \u00e2\u0080\u009ccourage, confidence and character.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She brings together a small group of young women, effectively founding one of the largest, most vital organizations for girls. One with a presence in every corner of the United States, today.\n1.7 million girls. 50 million alumnae.\nFor over one hundred years, Girls Scouts have played an active role in every cultural milestone of American history. From women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suffrage to civil rights, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been there. Pioneering female leadership in every discipline. Encouraging girls to act on their dreams and change the world for the better.\nAnd, with over 112 independent councils designing communications, the movement\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design approach needed a cohesive point of view.\nSo, the Girl Scouts invited us to work with them to craft just that. Beginning together in 2019, we sought to clarify the brand as an unignorable and hopeful cultural force.\nReaffirming its relevance in the lives of young women.\nReasserting the Girl Scout identity as a clear emblem of their mission.\nReorienting the movement\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legacy to fuel the future.\nSOLUTION\nWe started with a question: what does \u00e2\u0080\u009cpreparing girls to meet the world with courage, confidence and character\u00e2\u0080\u009d mean today?\nWe recognized the importance of championing all girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ambitions\u00e2\u0080\u0094work that the Girl Scouts has been doing for over 100 years. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve provided girls with the support to act on their aims and savor their accomplishments.\nTogether with their remarkable team, we worked to define a clear brand platform centered on being a champion of girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ambition and sought to bring that idea to life through every expression of the brand.\nStarting with their symbol.\nThe Girl Scouts movement has been represented by the Trefoil since its inception. It has seen many iterations, ranging from the American Eagle to girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 silhouettes. The Trefoil, now simplified, embodies its most potent, iconic essence.\nBeyond the logo, a new brand system needed to address the reality of having dozens of energetic councils designing communications for the same brand. The councils needed tools that would provide coherence across the country and offer flexibility to support their different communities. We were inspired by the visuality and history of Girl Scout patches and badges. These are artifacts of achievement that girls proudly wear to tell their own story; their goals, their accomplishments, their interests, their identities. We translated these objects into bold, geometric forms that could be used as building blocks for design and interactivity. The system grants a common language to all communications and is flexible enough to support any application, whether it be a presentation template or a vibrant campaign.\nWe developed a voice that looks girls in the eye, recognizes everything they are and can do, and seeks to empower them to blaze the trails only they can. To support that voice, we also worked with the Girl Scouts creative team and Positype to commission a distinct custom typeface.\nIn addition to the strategic, visual and verbal identity, we were asked to define how these tools extend into apparel and merchandise. How might we reinforce the relevance of this brand through gear that girls are excited to wear? By resurfacing archived styles with a contemporary take, the Girl Scouts can look to their original, beautiful catalogs for a wellspring of design inspiration.\nAnd the Trefoil, while rooted in green, can now selectively expand beyond green-only applications. So the Girl Scouts and their mission can come to life in multicolor\u00e2\u0080\u0094and with an expressiveness that reflects the vibrancy of the world around us.\nTo that end, we invited a diverse group of women artists and designers (both emerging voices as well as celebrated masters) to create a series of posters that express their experience of Girl Scouts. The series includes new talent like Cyra Cupid (RISD, 2021) and Jingqi Fan (Washington University, 2020) as well as, among others, AIGA Medalists Gail Anderson, Karin Fong, Debbie Millman, Noreen Morioka and Cheryl Miller (whose work as a designer began as a Girl Scout.)\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re honored to have worked with the remarkable people at Girl Scouts of the USA. This new brand system looks back at its legacy only to point forward and reassert what the movement has always been:\nFormative in girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives.\nAs it was in 1912.\nAs it is today and tomorrow.\n",

The strategy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStubborn Optimism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d spoke to the truth at the heart of the product experience: No matter where you are or what your mood, an ice-cold bottle of Coca-Cola can flood your mind with happy memories and thoughts. The shape of the bottle alone conveyed this idea with almost everyone around the world. Herein resided the design story Coca-Cola needed to share globally.\nSolution\nThe concept behind the identity visualized the emotions and memories that bubble up in all of us when we open a bottle of Coca-Cola. And open up the bottle we did: We invited artists, painters, designers, illustrators and even consumers to participate in and co-create the brand with us. Anything uplifting they could imagine with Coca-Cola we showed a way to make it come out of their iconic contour bottle.\nResults\nTo this day, Coca-Cola continues to make the silhouette bottle central to its global campaigns, including Wieden + Kennedy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarkable \u00e2\u0080\u009cOpen Happiness\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Coke Side of Life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve highlighted here with grey backgrounds.\n",

Entire industries have been upended, invented and reinvented. Societies, too, have been shaped by the instant ubiquity of new technologies. From smartphones to keyless cars, the novel becomes the normal in a blink.\nYet without the ability to anticipate the implications of new, ever more powerful tools, applications, widgets and whatnot, even the most promising breakthroughs can be compromised. Think: Social media co-opted for surveillance. Plastic metastasized into permanent pollution. Cities planned to accommodate cars rather than people.\nThis is where design as a practice can help people recognize the immediate and long term consequences of any actions they might consider to achieve their intentions. Designers are trained to learn from the past, think in terms of dynamic systems, and adapt and iterate with change.\nFew design philosophies captured this ideal as well as the Bauhaus. They held design up as a bold statement of optimism, one infused with creativity, curiosity and a profound sense of mission. It was as much about the future as it was the present.\nAgainst the specter of Nazism, a fascist nightmare at complete odds with these ideals, the Bauhaus disbanded. But the movement spread. In 1937, Bauhausler L\u00c3\u00a1szl\u00c3\u00b3 Moholy-Nagy founded the New Bauhaus in Chicago, which later became the Institute of Design (ID) at Illinois Tech.\nIn the eighty-five years since, many of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ground-breaking creative leaders have taught at ID, including Jay Doblin, Katherine and Michael McCoy, John Cage, Massimo Vignelli, Gy\u00c3\u00b6rgy Kepes, Sharon Poggenpohl, Harry Callahan and Buckminster Fuller. As it teaches this generation of learners and leaders, ID continues to push the frontiers of design\u00e2\u0080\u0094pioneering methods to solve for an array of daunting and urgent societal, cultural, environmental and business challenges.\nTHE PROBLEM\nThe problem is design. Or rather the perception of design.\nFor many, design is simply what something looks like. They are oblivious to its power to transform what is into what should be.\nFor ID graduates and faculty, design is a proven process to envision and build better, more responsible futures. Yet for prospective students and potential business partners, design is limited to visual arts and product development. They are unaware that design can accelerate the trajectory of their careers, transform companies and improve communities.\nAs the Institute of Design\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 85th anniversary approached, COLLINS was invited to help evolve ID for the future\u00e2\u0080\u0094and build a new identity around their vision of the transformative power of design.\nTHE SOLUTION\nIt quickly became clear that ID does not view design as a tool for revolution or disruption. This is not about tearing down the old to make way for the new. Rather, design is used to identify possibilities, focus on the most promising and refine the best. At ID, design is a dynamic process building towards positive impact.\nThe idea of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Evolutionary\u00e2\u0080\u009d led us to imagine a new voice and visual language that could itself evolve. Inspired by Moholy-Nagy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s artistic experiments with geometry and ID\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legendary director Jay Doblin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genius with complex systems, we crafted six foundational structures able to transform from abstract shapes into words and images. They, like design itself, move seamlessly from chaos to clarity.\nThe dynamism of this system is ID\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story, providing a voice and a canvas to show students, businesses\u00e2\u0080\u0094everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0094the extraordinary power of design to create possibilities that are both positive and impactful.\nAn idea even more urgent today than it was in 1937.\n",

By supporting individual filmmakers to explore remarkable stories of the sports world, 30 for 30 has become synonymous with Academy Award-winning, culture-altering films.\nThe team at ESPN invited COLLINS to think about a new challenge: What does the next ten years look like?\nThe entertainment landscape is rapidly evolving and filled with new players. At the same time, the 30 for 30 brand has expanded to include podcasts, shorts, and events.\nHow should its leaders define its new future while remaining true to its original vision?\nSolution\nTo imagine the future of the brand, we started by looking at the past to distill what makes 30 for 30 so meaningful. Through research and conversations with the ESPN Films team and with viewers, what we found was surprising. While each 30 for 30 film revolves around a human element, what leaves a mark in people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minds isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t only interesting events in sports history or newfound appreciation of an athlete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deeper understanding of a unique moment in time, in culture and society\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what it all meant.\n30 for 30 explores these diverse, unknown or often hidden stories and weaves them into daring, unforgettable films.\nWe used this as our foundation for a new way to convey the 30 for 30 brand for the next generation. Our idea weaves together inspiration from old scoreboards in legendary baseball stadiums to mid-century movie title sequences to 1990s football team uniforms\u00e2\u0080\u0094mixing different elements of culture as 30 for 30 does.\nThe new design system asserts itself more boldly, but never at the expense of the the story. The brand now can thrive across its new platforms and new technology formats. Digital shorts, podcasts, events, and the films themselves all work together to drive one strong, cohesive voice and presence.\nWith a new slate of films that promise to keep the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait to see what our friends at 30 for 30 will explore in their next ten years.\n",
